                                        INTRODUCTION TO JAVA
                                        =====================

*JAVA:it is a object oriented programming language.
-->it is initialy invented by james gosling

-->JAVA is a case sensitive.
-->JAVA is a platform independent,which can run in any ios.
-->because of byte form java is independent platform.
 
*JAVA COMPILER:it converts source code to binary code.
-------------

*INTERPRETER: which converts byte code to binary code this process is called interpretation.
-----------
-->JAVA  has 3 versions:
I.JSE

II.JEE

III.JME

I.JSE :
=====
-->JSE stands for java standard edition.
-->we can implement desktop applications or console applications.
-->desktop application means which can only excuted in single system or os.
eg:-games,MS office,media players.
-->console applications like editplus,notepad.

II.JEE:
=======
-->JEE stands for java enterprise edition.
-->This is for business applications.
-->web applications like server.which will be installed and executed in server system.
eg:-online games.
diff between web application and enterprise application:
--------------------------------------------------------
-->if it is web application we follow 2 tire architecture,sometimes it also follow 3 tire architecture to store database
-->if it is eneterprise application we follow n tire architecture.
III.JME:
=======
-->JME stands for java micro/mobile edition.
-->JME is used to implement java mobile applications

JDK:
---
JDK stands for java development kit.

JDK  is a software which is used to implement the java applications.

JDK=JRE+JVM
*JRE:
-->JRE stands for java run time environment.
-->JRE provides run time environment for java programs
*JVM:
=====
-->JVM stands for java virtualmachine.
-->which converts byte code to binary code with help of JIT
-->In JVM there is JIT which stands for "just in time"
-->JIT converts byte code to binary code.

FEATURES OF JAVA:
================
1.object-oriented.
2.paltform independent.
3.simple.
4.secure.
5.portable.
6.robust.
7.multithread.
8.distributed.
